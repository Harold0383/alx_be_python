# Principal amount, interest rate, and time
principal = 1000  # Initial investment
rate = 0.05  # Annual interest rate (as a decimal)
time = 3  # Time in years

# Calculate simple interest
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the result
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest:.2f}")  # Format to 2 decimal places
